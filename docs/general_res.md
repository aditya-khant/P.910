# General Resources

There are general resources required for the HIT APP to function properly.

1. Upload files you find here `src/template/assets/imgs/*` into a cloud server, make them publicly available and change 
URLs you find in the following HTML files:
     - `src/template/DCR_template.html`
     
1. Upload the links in the `src/assets_master_script/general.csv`:
    - Column `block_matrix_url` should contain URLs of files you find here `src/template/assets/imgs/block_matrix_5points/*`.
